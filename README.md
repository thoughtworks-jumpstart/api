## Create a new resource

To create a new resource simply add a new property to `db.json`. See example [here](https://github.com/typicode/demo/blob/master/db.json).

```json
{
  "posts": [
    { "id": 1, "title": "Post 1" },
    { "id": 2, "title": "Post 2" },
    { "id": 3, "title": "Post 3" }
  ],
  "comments": [
    { "id": 1, "body": "some comment", "postId": 1 },
    { "id": 2, "body": "some comment", "postId": 1 }
  ]
}
```

This creates two resources posts and comments and these endpoints

- GET `/posts` - gets all posts
- GET `/posts/1` - gets one post with `id`
- GET `/comments` - gets all comments
- GET `/comments/1` - gets one comment with `id`
- GET `/posts/1/comments` - gets all comments belonging to a post
